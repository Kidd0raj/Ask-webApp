    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Our journey with ASK began with a shared passion for making web development accessible to beginners. Inspired by our own struggles as beginners, we envisioned a platform that simplifies the learning process. This project is a result of collaboration, dedication, and the belief that learning should be both enjoyable and practical.</p>
    <p>This project is part of our Portfolio at Holberton School, where we've been honing our skills in software development. Feel free to explore our individual profiles and connect with us on LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter. ASK is an ongoing project, and we're excited about what the future holds!</p>
